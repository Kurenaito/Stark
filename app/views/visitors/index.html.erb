<h1>Welcome to the Stark Internship!</h1>
<p> "Well, I'm not Tony Stark.  But if I were Tony..."

Look, this is my personal project to attempt to become a:</p>
<br>
<h1>Genius - Billionaire - Playboy - Philanthropist</h1>
<br>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Genius</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Billionaire</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Playboy</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Philanthropist</button>
<br>
<p>To do so, I will follow the inspiration of Tony Stark as portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr. in the Marvel movies.  As such, it should be noted that:</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li> This will be based on the movies, not the comics (don't be surprised if I am completely ignorant of details found only in the comics)</li>
	<li> My goal is to become "like" Tony Stark, but not become Tony Stark 100% (I'm not legally changing my name, becoming an alcoholic, changing my wife's name to "Pepper," etc.)</li>
	<li> I will be adding "Non-Tony" inspiration as well to help round out the picture (Remember how they added frog DNA to dinosaur DNA in "Jurassic Park?")</li>
</ul>
<p>No that that's out of the way, let's get started!</p>

<h2>Vision:</h2>
<p>"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute." Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged
</p>
<br>
<p>"Tony, he always gets the good stuff."</p>
<br>
<p>"The best thing about Tony, is also the worst thing.  He's always working."</p>
<br>
<p>"Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave...with a box of scraps!"</p>
